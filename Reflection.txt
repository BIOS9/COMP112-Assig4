Questions for Reflection: 
=========================

1. The series of methods in ClassTimes were progressively more tricky. Identify
what it was about the later ones that made them more difficult.

2. The lines in classdata.txt were sorted by the coursecode. What queries would
be easier or have nicer output if they had been sorted by one of the other columns?


Answers for Reflection:
========================

The later questions had to combine and compare different data from different sources, this was what made it more difficult because I had to decide what data to grab from the file and where and how to store it. I also had to figure out how to compare the data, this was tricky for some data like the time because you cant just subtract the given time format to get a time span.

Since the course collumn was sorted, all results returned are sorted by course. I was originally going to use a binary search to quickly find the requested data. I didn't end up doing this because it would only have worked for a course search, and the scanner doesn't have any way to skip or jump to lines in the file. I think any query where you want to see the course comes out with a nicer output because its sorted. If you were mainly looking at another field, it would have been nicer if it was sorted by that field. I could have sorted the output of my program based on user input, but I didn't see much point as the data returned by the program is usually not that large.
